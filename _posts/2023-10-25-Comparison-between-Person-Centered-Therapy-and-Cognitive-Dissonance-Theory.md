Connecting two concepts that I recently read abot.
<--!more-->

# Theories

The *Person-Centered Therapy*  has a positive look on the individual. This Humanistic approach emphasises on the process of Self-Actualization for growth and development. It also includes theories on how an individual behaves if faced with Incongruence in the view of the Self.

*Cognitive Dissonance Theory* aims at explaining attitude change by a drive to reduce Cognitive Dissonance through applying different strategies.


# Comparison

Both theories were formulated in roughly the same period that featured the behaviourist movement. Both re-introduced the role of Cognition in their explanations.

The role of Cognition is expanded in the Person-Centered Therapy through the concept of Self. If the individual perceives a threat to Self-Consistency, they might react through a Defence Mechanism. 

Similarly, according to Cognitive Dissonance Theory an individual reduces a threat to Cognitive Consistency by altering different factors of the Cognition.

The state of Incongruence is comparable to Dissonance. Insufficient Justification would require Distortion or Denial to achieve this attitude change and reach Cognitive Consistency again.
